I’m Youssouf EL ALLIOUI, and I obtained my PhD in 2012 from [Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University]( http://www.usmba.ac.ma/), Fez, Morocco. Currently, I am a professor in the Department of Computer Science at [Sultan Moulay Slimane University](http://www.usms.ac.ma/website/), Beni Mellal, Morocco. 

My research spans several multidisciplinary fields, including machine learning, educational data mining (EDM), the semantic web, knowledge management, web personalization, recommender systems, e-learning, and semantic e-learning. I focus on exploring these areas to develop solutions for various real-world challenges.

I have published numerous research papers in international journals and conferences, and I have served on the technical committees of various international conferences and workshops.

Since 2013, I have been a member of the program & reading committees for several conferences and journals, including [The Journal of Big Data](https://journalofbigdata.springeropen.com/), the Journal of e-Learning and Knowledge Society [Je-LKS](http://www.je-lks.org/ojs/index.php/Je-LKS_EN), and events such as the International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Computer Vision [ISCV'2020](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=iscv2020), The 3rd International Conference on Information Technology & Electrical Engineering [ITee'19](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=itee19), The 4th International Conference On Big Data and Internet of Things [BDIoT'19](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=bdiot19), International Conference On Embedded Systems And Artificial Intelligence [ESAI'19](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=esai19), The international conference on WIreless Technologies, embedded and intelligent Systems [WITS-2019](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=wits2019) , International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Computer Vision 2018 [ISCV2018](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=iscv2018), The 4th IEEE Conference on Information and Multimedia Processing IEEE [IMP2018](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=ieeeimp2018), The 3rd International Conference on Big Data, Cloud and Applications [BDCA'18](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=bdca18), The 2nd International Conference on Big Data, Cloud and Applications [BDCA'17](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=bdca17).

Since 2007, I have taught computer science across several departments and in various educational programs (including undergraduate, master’s, engineering, and professional training) at both public and private universities. My courses have covered topics such as Java EE frameworks ([ESTA-OFPPT](https://www.ofppt.ma/)), project management ([Sup'management](https://www.supmanagement.ma/index.php)), advanced web development and Objective-C ([FST-Settat](http://www.fsts.ac.ma/)), C++, UML, Algorithm ([FP-Khouribga](http://www.fpk.ac.ma/)) and more. For additional information, please refer to my [CV page](https://yelallioui.github.io/cv/).

Since 2014, I have served as the Education Coordinator for the Mathematics and Computer Science program, overseeing several key modules, including object-oriented programming, Unified Modeling Language (UML), algorithms and data structures, operating systems, computer architecture, and databases.

In addition to teaching, I have contributed to various activities at the [Polydisciplinary faculty of Khouribga](http://www.fpk.ac.ma/), including interviewing candidates and organizing recruitment competitions for IT development and network technician positions. I have also had the honor of coordinating the Mathematics and Computer Science program (SMI) since 2015. Moreover, from 2021 to 2024, I have served as an active member of the university council, as well as a member of both the finance and scientific research committees. Additionally, I participate in recruitment committees for faculty positions. Throughout my career, I have consistently aimed to contribute to the development of the institution, remaining deeply involved in both academic management and research activities.
